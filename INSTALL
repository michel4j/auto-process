AutoProcess Installation
------------------------

1. Pre-requisites
    ** Python modules available for most Linux distributions
    - Python 2.6 and above is required
    - numpy
    - scipy
    - matplotlib
    - Django
    
    ** Crystallography packages
    - XDS
    - Phenix
    - CCP4 packages (especially POINTLESS and F2MTZ)
    - BEST (http://www.embl-hamburg.de/BEST/) (only needed for screening) version 3.2 works, 3.4 may work but has a few issues
    - (optional) python-twisted (8.0 and above) for data processing server. Usually not required.
    - An up-to-date Linux kernel on all machines on which you will be running XDS. 
      Some unpatched kernel versions have a deadlock bug which causes XDS to hang during integrate
    
    ** Others
    - CBFlib in order to work with cbf formated files such as those produced by PILATUS
    
    ** On Fedora Linux with RPMFusion repositories enabled, the following should install all pre-requisites except for the Crystallography packages
       
       yum -y install numpy scipy python-matplotlib python-django
 
2. Installation
    - unpack the tar archive in a directory of your choice such as /usr/local/AutoProcess-3 or any folder of your choice. It doesn't matter.
    - edit the 'dpm.csh' and 'dpm.sh' files in the subfolder 'deploy' to match the installation. See the comments in those files.
    - copy those files to a location such that they are sourced at login, or source them from your shell login scripts.
    - Make sure all the required packages are in your path.
    - Setup ssh password-less login on all machines you want to use as data processing slaves, as configured in dpm.csh or dpm.sh. 
      Adding more machines with multiple cores speeds up data processing. See the example for a 96 core cluster. 
    - rename the versions of forkintegrate and forkcolspot which come with XDS so that the versions in AutoProcess are used instead.
    
3. Run AutoProcess
    - type 'auto.process -h' for help. You can also check our web site here (http://cmcf.lightsource.ca/user-guide/autoprocess/) for more information. 
      Other tools available include auto.analyse, auto.inputs, auto.integrate, auto.report, auto.scale, auto.strategy, auto.symmetry.
