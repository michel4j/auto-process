AutoProcess Installation
------------------------

1. Pre-requisites
    ** Python modules available for most Linux distributions
    - Python 2.6 and above is required
    - numpy
    - scipy
    - matplotlib
    - pygtk2
    - Django
    - python-imaging OR pythong-pillow

    
    ** Crystallography packages
    - XDS (Jan 2014 version at least)
    - Phenix (Version 1.9-1692)
    - CCP4 packages (especially POINTLESS and F2MTZ)
    - BEST (http://www.embl-hamburg.de/BEST/) (only needed for screening) 
      version 3.2 works, 3.4 may work but has a few issues
    - (optional) python-twisted (8.0 and above) for data processing server and imgview. 
      Usually not required.
    - An up-to-date Linux kernel on all machines used for running XDS. 
      Some unpatched kernel versions have a deadlock bug which causes hang-ups
      during integrate.
    
    ** Others
    - CBFlib in order to work with cbf formated files such as those produced by
      PILATUS
    
    ** On Fedora/RedHat Linux with RPMFusion repositories enabled, the following should
       install all pre-requisites except for the Crystallography packages
       
       yum -y install numpy scipy python-matplotlib python-django CBFlib python-twisted python-imaging
 
2. Installation
    - unpack the tar archive in a directory of your choice such as 
      /usr/local/AutoProcess-XXXXXXXX or any folder of your choice. It doesn't matter.
    - edit the 'dpm.csh' and 'dpm.sh' files in the subfolder 'deploy' to match 
      the installation. See the comments in those files.
    - copy those files to a location such that they are sourced at login, or 
      source them from your shell login scripts.
    - Make sure all the required packages are in your path.
    - Setup ssh password-less login (http://www.linuxproblem.org/art_9.html) on 
      all machines you want to use as data processing slaves (including your 
      local machine), as configured in dpm.csh or dpm.sh. Adding more machines 
      with multiple cores speeds up data processing. See the example for a 96 
      core cluster.
    - Make sure the directories in which you'll be processing data from/in have
      exactly the same path on all machines configured (Use NFS). Also make sure
      all the machines are the same architecture and preferably the same 
      operating system version. You can not mix x86 and AMD64.
    - rename the versions of forkintegrate and forkcolspot which come with XDS 
      so that the versions in AutoProcess are used instead.
    - You can use a single machine to run AutoProcess but it might be very slow
      unless you have a lot of cores in it. If you want integration to happen 
      elsewhere while other tasks run locally, omit your local host from 
      dpm.csh & dpm.sh
    
3. Run AutoProcess
    - type 'auto.process -h' for help. You can also check our web site here 
      (http://cmcf.lightsource.ca/user-guide/autoprocess/) for more information. 
      Other tools available include auto.analyse, auto.inputs, auto.integrate, 
      auto.report, auto.scale, auto.strategy, auto.symmetry.
    - To be able to solve small molecule structures, you need to have SHELX and XPREP 
      installed.
